# DMOJ Solutions

The `solutions` folder contains my AC to DMOJ problems. Each submission included is my first accepted solution for the problem (since I might've submitted other users' code after).

I originally created this project to practice web scraping, but I later realized that using `info.json` was a more efficient approach (`notscraper.py`). My `scraper.py` also gets blocked by Cloudflare lol.
