# DMOJ Solutions

The solutions folder contains my AC to DMOJ problems. Each submission included is my first accepted solution for the problem (since I might've submitted other users' code after).

I originally created this project to practice web scraping, but I later realized that using `info.json` was a more efficient approach (notscraper.py). My scraper.py also gets blocked by Cloudflare lol.
